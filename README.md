## About this project
This is a fangame I'm developing in ***Godot Engine 4.3***, and my goal is to create a full game (while also learning how to make games, since this is the first one I'm making) based on the Metroidvania genre.

I am sharing the source code because this project is open source, as I am not __*monetizing this game in any way*__, and I am more than glad to help people figure out or toy with the code that makes my game run.
If you would like to help me in any way, please consider contacting me on Discord (tag is .shuan).

## About the game
This game is a fan sequel to ***Castlevania: Curse of Darkness***, a 3D Castlevania released in 2005 for the PS2, which tells about the tale of Hector, a forgemaster who can summon demons that fight for him, seeking revenge while facing hordes of creatures of the night.
This game aims to take the distinctive elements of ***Castlevania: Curse of Darkness*** and reproduce them in a 2D Metroidvania context, while also taking inspiration from other games in the franchise such as ***Symphony of the Night***, ***Lament of Innocence*** and the DS Castlevania titles.

## What you can find here
- If you want to play the game, you can get the .exe or .apk in the Releases page.
- If you instead want to open the project in Godot, you can download the source code and then open project.godot in Godot Engine 4.3.

> [!WARNING]
> When opening this project, **please use Godot Engine 4.3**, as the project is not compatible with older versions of the engine, and 4.4 *breaks room transitions*.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, the Release page **only contains executables for Windows and Android**, but you *can open the project in Godot on your device and compile it there*, so even if you're on Linux or Mac, you still have a way to play the game.
