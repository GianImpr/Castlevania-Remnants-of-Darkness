## About this project
This is a fangame I'm developing in Godot Engine 4.3, and my goal is to create a full game (while also learning how to make games, since this is the first one I'm making) based on the Metroidvania genre.

I am sharing the source code because this project is open source, as I am not __*monetizing this game in any way*__, and I am more than glad to help people figure out or toy with the code that makes my game run.
If you would like to help me in any way, please consider contacting me on Discord (tag is .shuan).
